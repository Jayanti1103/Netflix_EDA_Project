# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project is an *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* of the Netflix dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  
The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights about Netflixâ€™s content library, trends over the years, and distribution of shows/movies by type, genre, and country.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- Netflix_EDA.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook with full data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.  
- netflix_titles.csv â†’ Dataset used for the analysis.  
- README.md â†’ Project documentation.
  
## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ðŸ”Ž Key Steps in the Project
1. *Data Collection* â†’ Dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
2. *Data Cleaning* â†’ Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting.  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* â†’  
   - Content distribution by year  
   - Movies vs TV Shows  
   - Top genres & countries  
   - Trends in Netflixâ€™s global expansion  
4. *Visualizations* â†’ Bar charts, line plots, heatmaps for insights.
